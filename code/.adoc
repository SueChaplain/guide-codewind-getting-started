= Overview of Kabanero, Appsody, Codewind, and Tekton

== Learning objectives

. Gain a conceptual understanding of Kabanero’s functions and Kabanero’s subcomponents: Appsody, Codewind, Tekton.

. Learn how Codewind works within Kabanero and with Kabanero’s other parts, Appsody and Tekton, in order to build cloud native applications.

== Kabanero overview 

Kabanero is an open source project focused on bringing together foundational open source technologies into a modern microservices-based framework. Use Kabanero to build applications that are ready for deployment onto Kubernetes and Knative, without having to spend time defining container images or building infrastructure. Focus on developing new applications and let the Kabanero tools do the heavy lifting of building and packaging deployment-ready containers.

Kabanero has four key features:

*1. Kabanero Collections*

Kabanero Collections are logical collections, stored and managed in a GitHub repository. During the development phase, the collection seamlessly empowers developers to build applications and microservices to the architect’s standard configuration. Collections allow standardization and customization. 

*2. Kabanero Foundation*

Installing Kabanero Foundation will allow you to activate, manage, and share collections with your team and maintain governance over each piece of the collection. Kabanero Foundation is installed in a Kubernetes cluster using a Kubernetes Operator. 

*3. Management CLI*

Using the Command Line Interface (CLI), you choose a collection and configure it. You then can set up your pipelines and share the pipelines with your development team so they can start to build applications. 

*4. Developer Tools* 

Developer tools give your team access to the collection(s) that have been activated in Kabanero Foundation. Other public Kabanero Collections are also available for developers to use in either Visual Studio Code or Eclipse and also can be used in conjunction with their CLI using XCode. 

*Kabanero's components and how it all works* 

Kabanero has three components, which all work together to execute Kabanero’s features and tasks. These components are:

. Appsody, the architect phase
. Codewind, the coding phase
. Tekton, the deployment phase

You need to use all three of Kabanero’s components in order to build cloud native applications. You install Kabanero to ensure integration and cooperation among its three components, and each component requires its own installations. 

With cloud native projects, architects and developers face new challenges, like having to work with microservices and more technology than they used to. Kabanero helps these professionals select the technologies and cloud services best for their needs. Here is an explanation of Kabanero and all its moving parts:

With Kabanero, Champ (a solution architect) builds preconfigured stacks which allow him to decide which languages and frameworks are used, how they are used, and how they interact with his platform. The platform Champ builds includes the preconfigured stacks and decided framework. Champ then gives these platforms to Jane (the lead developer), so now she can build and deploy microservices from the given preconfigured stacks.  During the Appsody stage in Kabanero, the stacks, frameworks, and platforms are created. 

Jane discovers the stacks available to her by using the CLI. Once Jane has chosen the project type she wants to build, and once she has made a new directory for her application, she can type “app dev init” in the CLI. This command pulls down Champ’s stacks and adds them to Jane’s application, giving her an iterative development environment using her application and Champs’s specified platform runtime stack. This stack also allows Jane to develop in any IDE of her choosing, like Eclipse or VS Code. During the Codewind stage in Kabanero, the code is built, tested, and debugged. 

The CLI provides a build command to allow Jane to set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Jane can use this pipeline for her Git project or for a local build. When Jane commits the code to GitHub, the pipeline pushes the code to a Kubernetes cluster on OpenShift Cloud. If Jane is building locally, the pipeline takes Jane’s application and Champ’s stacks and uses the two to build a full microservice inside a Docker container that can be used anywhere. During the Tekton stage in Kabanero, the CI/CD pipeline automates and deploys code. 

See the following diagram for an illustration of how Kabanero’s components work with one another to build cloud native applications. Read about each component and its specific functions in greater detail throughout this guide.

=== Appsody overview

Appsody simplifies Kabanero's creation of cloud-native applications in containers. Appsody provides pre-configured container images, or stacks, that are prebuilt, cloud optimized development and production configurations for different languages and Microservice frameworks. These stacks provide a foundation to build applications for Kubernetes and Knative deployments.

If you're a software developer, Appsody aims to remove the burden of managing the full software development stack. With Appsody, you can build applications for the cloud that are ready to be deployed to Kubernetes without being an expert on the underlying container technology. You can simply focus on the important stuff - developing application code! Basically, by providing stacks and templates, Appsody allows developers to focus solely on coding during the Codewind phase.    

Appsody consists of three key features:

*1. Appsody Stacks*

Appsody provides pre-configured application stacks that enable rapid development of quality microservice-based applications. Stacks include a base container image and project templates which act as a starting point for your application development.

Appsody stacks include language runtimes, frameworks and any additional libraries and tools that are required to simplify your local application development. Stacks are an easy way to manage consistency and adopt best practices across many applications.

Appsody Hub is the central point of control for Appsody Stacks where you can find available stacks, create new stacks, or modify existing ones. By making changes to the stacks in the hub, you can deploy updates to any application that's been built on them, simply by restarting the application.

*2. Appsody CLI*

Working with the stacks, Appsody CLI provides commands that implement the full development lifecycle, so it has the ability to create a new or enable an existing application. Appsody CLI also provides commands to run, test, debug, and build an image and deploy it to Kubernetes. Appsody CLI works with Codewind so you can develop with the stacks directly in your choice of IDE using Codewind’s plugins. 

*3. Appsody Deploy*

Appsody deploy allows you to create a standard production optimized container image of your cloud native Microservices then deploy that image into Kubernetes using the deploy command. Appsody deploy utilizes Appsody Operator which minimizes the configuration required to deploy the Microservice so now you can deploy using a serverless deployment either through Knative or a Kubernetes service. 

=== Codewind overview 

Codewind provides Kabanero with IDE integration and extensions to popular IDEs like VS Code, Eclipse, and Eclipse Che. As an open source project under Eclipse, Codewind gives you a set of tools for you to use to build high quality cloud native applications for Kubernetes regardless of the IDE or language you use. When Codewind enhances your IDE, you can run your applications in a Docker container. So you now can rapidly iterate, debug, and perform test apps inside containers with the same environment as production and in your preferred IDE. During the Codewind phase, developers can simply code and not concern themselves with any other tasks. 

Codewind consists of four key features: 

*1. Inner Loop*

Codewind adopts the “inner loop” practice which basically is an iterative process that developers perform as they write, build, or debug code. The inner loop mostly has three parts: experimentation (example, coding), feedback collection (example, building) and tax (example, committing). Adopting the inner loop, Codewind quickens development and feedback.   

*2. Container Development Everywhere*

Codewind can support application development on any Kubernetes cluster. If you use a local IDE plugin, Codewind provides support on the Docker. With Codewind, you use the same tools in local or hosted IDE and run in local containers or deploy directly on Kubernetes.    

*3. IDE Support*

Codewind delivers native IDE integration with VS Code, Eclipse, and Eclipse Che. This way, regardless of your preferred IDE or language, you can use Codewind to build your cloud native application. 

*4. Developer Performance Monitoring*

Codewind automatically analyzes applications for performance issues. Configurable load testing makes code changes which immediately show through live and historical performance graphs. 

=== Tekton overview

Tekton is a Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. Tekton lets you build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems. Tekton provides open-source components to help standardize your CI/CD tooling and processes across vendors, languages, and deployment environments. 

Tekton pipeline is a collection of tasks, and each task is a set of instructions to execute within a container. The pipeline can then automate common activities in Kubernetes environments. Tekton takes all the work, development, build, and code from the Codewind phase and uses its pipeline to deploy Codewind’s outcomes to OpenShift Cloud. 

Tekton consists of four key features: 

*1. Steps*

A step is a container spec which is a container image with all the information that you need to run it. Steps are also the most basic building blocks of Tekton pipelines.  Steps run in sequential order on the same Kubernetes node. 

*2. Tasks*

Tasks are made up by steps. Tasks are custom resource definitions (CRDs). Tasks can run sequentially or concurrently on different nodes. Tasks make up a pipeline. 

*3. Pipelines*

Pipelines express the order of the tasks. Pipelines connect the outputs of one task with the inputs of another. Pipelines: git clones, build docker images, publish images to repositories, and deploys images. 

*4. Dashboard* 

The dashboard is the web user interface for Tekton Pipelines. The dashboard inputs runtime parameters into pipeline runs and views the execution logs of the pipeline runs. A deployment pipeline is an automated manifestation of your software process from version control all the way to production. It ensures a consistent, repeatable and reliable way to release software to production including new releases, fixes, security patches basically anything released to production should always go through this automated process.
