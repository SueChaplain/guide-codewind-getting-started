=== Developing with VS Code

Why VS Code? You can use Codewind for Visual Studio Code to develop and debug your containerized projects from within VS Code.

Write code, track application and build statuses, view project logs, and run your application.
Codewind for VS Code supports development of Microprofile/Java EE, Java Lagom, Spring, Node.js, Go, Python, Swift, and Appsody containerized projects.
In addition, the tools support easily debugging Microprofile/Java EE, Spring, and Node.js applications.

The VS Code tools are open source. You can browse the code, open issues, and contribute.

*Install Codewind for VS Code*

The Codewind installation includes two parts:

. The VS Code extension installs when you install Codewind from the VS Code Marketplace or when you install by searching in the `VS Code Extensions` view.
. The Codewind back end containers install after you click `Install` when you are prompted. After you click `Install`, the necessary images are downloaded from the internet. The download is approximately 1 GB.
. Optional: If you don’t click `Install` when the notification window first appears, you can access the notification again. Go to the Explorer view, hover the cursor over `Codewind`, and click the switch so that it changes to the `On` position. The window appears. 

The following images are pulled. These images together form the Codewind back end:
```
. eclipse/codewind-initialize-amd64
. eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64 
. eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64
```
When the installation is complete, the extension is ready to use, and you are prompted to open the `Codewind workspace.`

Codewind creates the `~/codewind-workspace` folder to contain your projects. 
On Windows, you can find the workspace at the `C:\codewind-workspace` folder. 
You can open the `codewind-workspace` or a project within the workspace as your VS Code workspace.

You no longer need to install an Appsody Extension because Appsody is integrated into Codewind 0.3.0.

*Create an Appsody project*

. Create a new MicroProfile project. Hover over the `Projects` entry underneath `Codewind in Visual Studio Code` and press the `+` icon to create a new project.
. Choose the `Appsody Eclipse Microprofile Template` and give the project a name, like `Appsody Calculator` (in this example).
. Press `Enter` to create the project. 
. If you don't see Appsody templates, go to the section, `Create an Appsody template for VS Code`.

Create an Appsody template for VS Code:

. For Macs, press `Command+P`. 
. For Windows, press `Control+P`.
. Press `Shift+>`.
. You now see a list of commands. 
. Find and select `Codewind: Manage Template Sources`. 
. Enable the `Appsody Stacks - appsodyhub`.
. Continue to create an Appsody project by following the steps for the section, `Create an Appsody project`. 

The project has now been generated and takes a little time to build due it being a Microprofile with multiple dependencies. To monitor the progress, expand `Codewind -> Projects` and right click the menu option `Show all logs:`

After several minutes, you should see a log message like the following:
```
[Container] [�[1;34mINFO�[m] [AUDIT   ] CWWKF0011I: The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The defaultServer server started in 69.467 seconds.
```
And the project status should change to `Running`.

To access the application endpoint in a browser, select the Open App icon next to the project's name, or right-click on the project and select the Open App menu option. This opens up the application in the running container showing the Welcome to your Appsody Microservice page.

Let's take a look at the code. In the `VS Code EXPLORER` you should see a `CODEWIND-WORKSPACE` entry with your project name. If you don't find it, right-click on the project and choose Add Folder to Workspace. In the workspace view, expand the project and the sub-folders to show all the files created from the Appsody template (Note, the template is not intended to be a sample as most people would end up having to delete the code each time, it aims to provide the starter code, server configuration and build to which you can add your code).

The main Java files are StarterLivenessCheck, StarterReadinessCheck and StarterApplication. The first two provide the outlines for liveness and readiness checks that can be hooked up to Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes. These are implemented using MicroProflie Health. The third file is a JAX-RS application, which provides the Application Path for your REST API.

Let's add a REST service to your application. Navigate to the `src/main/java/dev/appsody/starter` directory, and create a file called `Calculator.java` - this will be our JAX-RS resource. Populate the file with the following code and save it:
```
package dev.appsody.starter;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import java.util.List;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status;

import jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.annotations.Getter;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;

@Path("/calculator")
public class Calculator extends Application {
    
    @GET
    @Path("/aboutme")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public response aboutme(){
        return "You can add (+), subtract (-), and multiply (*) with this simple calculator.";
    }

	@GET
    @Path("/{op}/{a}/{b}")
	@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public Response calculate(@PathParam("op") String op, @PathParam("a") String a, @PathParam("b") String b)
    {
        int numA = Integer.parseInt(a);
        int numB = Integer.parseInt(b);

      switch(op)
      {
          case "+":
              return Response.ok(a + "+" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA + numB)))).build();

          case "-":
              return Response.ok(a + "-" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA - numB)))).build();

          case "*":
              return Response.ok(a + "*" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA * numB)))).build();

          default:
          	return Response.ok("Invalid operation. Please Try again").build();
      }
    }
}
```
Any changes you make to your code will automatically be built and re-deployed by Codewind, and viewed in your browser. Let's see this in action.

If you still have the logs `OUTPUT` tab open you will see that the code is compiled and the application restarted. You should see messages like:
```
[Container] [�[1;34mINFO�[m] Source compilation was successful.
[Container] [�[1;34mINFO�[m] [AUDIT   ] CWWKT0017I: Web application removed (default_host): http://04013dbc9c11:9080/
[Container] [�[1;34mINFO�[m] [AUDIT   ] CWWKZ0009I: The application starter-app has stopped successfully.
[Container] [�[1;34mINFO�[m] [WARNING ] CWMH0053W: The readiness health check reported a DOWN overall status because the following applications have not started yet: [starter-app]
[Container] [�[1;34mINFO�[m] [AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://04013dbc9c11:9080/
```
Now we can do some interesting stuff with this new resource. You can point your browser at a couple of things (note, is the port number you saw when you first opened the application):

`http://127.0.0.1:/starter/calculator/aboutme` You should see the following response:
```
You can add (+), subtract (-), and multiply (*) with this simple calculator.
```
You could also try a few of the functions: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/{op}/{a}/{b}`, where you can input one of the available operations `(+, _, *)`, and an integer a, and an integer b.

So for `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/+/10/3` you should see: `10+3=13`.

To obtain your `<port>`:

. Right click your project.
. Select `Open Project Overview`.
. Find `Exposed App Port`and here is the port value.
. Copy the 'Exposed App Port`value and replace `<port>` in the URL with this value. 
. Make sure to remove the `< >` symbol in the URL. 

*Test the default endpoint*

. To make sure your code change was picked up, test your new endpoint.
    * Right-click the project and select `Open App.` The project root endpoint opens in the browser, and the `Appsody Microservice` page appears.
    * Navigate to the new endpoint. If you copied the previous snippet, add `/health/test/` to the URL.
    * See the new response: `Yep, it worked!!`

*Debug the app*

 . You can debug your application within the container. To debug a containerized project, restart it in `Debug` mode.
    * Right-click the project and select `Restart in Debug Mode.`
    * The project restarts into the `Debugging` state.
    * A debug launch configuration is created in `.vscode/launch.json`.
    * The debugger attaches, and VS Code opens the `Debug` view.
    * You can detach and reattach the debugger at any time, as long as the project is still in `Debug` mode.
    
 . All of the VS Code debug functionality is now available.
    * Refresh the new endpoint page that you opened in step 7 so that a new request is made, and the breakpoint gets hit.

If debugging does not work, complete the following:

. Select the `debug icon`.
. At the top, you see a green arrow, highlighting the debug session. 
. Use the drop down arrow to select the debug session that corresponds to your project. 
    
VS Code suspends your application at the breakpoint. Here you can step through the code, inspect variables, see the call stack, and evaluate expressions in the `Debug Console.`

*Run the app*

. Right click your project and select `Open App`.
