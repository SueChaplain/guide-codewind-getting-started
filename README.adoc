== 3. Kabanero Overview: 

*Kabanero:* 

Kabanero is an open source project focused on bringing together foundational open source technologies into a modern microservices-based framework. Use Kabanero to build applications that are ready for deployment onto Kubernetes and Knative, without having to spend time defining container images or building infrastructure. Focus on developing new applications and let the Kabanero tools do the heavy lifting of building and packaging deployment-ready containers.

Kabanero has four fey features:

*1. Kabanero Collections:*

Kabanero Collections are logical collections, stored and managed in a GitHub repository. During the development phase, the collection seamlessly empowers developers to build applications and microservices to the architect’s standard configuration. Collections allow standardization and customization. 

*2. Kabanero Foundation:*

Installing Kabanero Foundation will allow you to activate, manage, and share collections with your team and maintain governance over each piece of the collection. Kabanero Foundation is installed in a Kubernetes cluster using a Kubernetes Operator. 

*3. Managment CLI:*

Using the Command Line Interface (CLI), you choose a collection and configure it. You then can set up your pipelines and share the pipelines with your development team so they can start to build applications. 

*4. Developer Tools:* 

Developer tools give your team access to the collection(s) that have been activated in Kabanero Foundation. Other public Kabanero Collections are also available for developers to use in either Visual Studio Code or Eclipse and also can be used in conjunction with their CLI using XCode. 

*Kabanero's components and how it all works:* 

Kabanero has three components, which all work together to execute Kabanero’s features and tasks. These components are:

1. Appsody, the architect phase
2. Codewind, the coding phase
3. Tekton, the deployment phase

You need to use all three of Kabanero’s components in order to build cloud native applications. You install Kabanero to ensure integration and cooperation among its three components, and each component requires its own installations. 

With cloud native projects, architects and developers face new challenges, like having to work with microservices and more technology than they used to. Kabanero helps these professionals select the technologies and cloud services best for their needs. Here is an explanation of Kabanero and all its moving parts:

With Kabanero, Champ (a solution architect) builds preconfigured stacks which allow him to decide which languages and frameworks are used, how they are used, and how they interact with his platform. The platform Champ builds includes the preconfigured stacks and decided framework. Champ then gives these platforms to Jane (the lead developer), so now she can build and deploy microservices from the given preconfigured stacks.  During the Appsody stage in Kabanero, the stacks, frameworks, and platforms are created. 

Jane discovers the stacks available to her by using the CLI. Once Jane has chosen the project type she wants to build, and once she has made a new directory for her application, she can type “app dev init” in the CLI. This command pulls down Champ’s stacks and adds them to Jane’s application, giving her an iterative development environment using her application and Champs’s specified platform runtime stack. This stack also allows Jane to develop in any IDE of her choosing, like Eclipse or VS Code. During the Codewind stage in Kabanero, the code is built, tested, and debugged. 

The CLI provides a build command to allow Jane to set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Jane can use this pipeline for her Git project or for a local build. When Jane commits the code to GitHub, the pipeline pushes the code to a Kubernetes cluster on OpenShift Cloud. If Jane is building locally, the pipeline takes Jane’s application and Champ’s stacks and uses the two to build a full microservice inside a Docker container that can be used anywhere. During the Tekton stage in Kabanero, the CI/CD pipeline automates and deploys code. 

See the following diagram for an illustration of how Kabanero’s components work with one another to build cloud native applications. Read about each component and its specific functions in greater detail throughout this guide.

*Diagram of Kabanero's components:*

== 4. Appsody Overview:

*Appsody:*

Appsody simplifies Kabanero's creation of cloud-native applications in containers. Appsody provides pre-configured container images, or stacks, that are prebuilt, cloud optimized development and production configurations for different languages and Microservice frameworks. These stacks provide a foundation to build applications for Kubernetes and Knative deployments.

If you're a software developer, Appsody aims to remove the burden of managing the full software development stack. With Appsody, you can build applications for the cloud that are ready to be deployed to Kubernetes without being an expert on the underlying container technology. You can simply focus on the important stuff - developing application code! Basically, by providing stacks and templates, Appsody allows developers to focus solely on coding during the Codewind phase.    

Appsody consists of three key features:

*1. Appsody Stacks:*

Appsody provides pre-configured application stacks that enable rapid development of quality microservice-based applications. Stacks include a base container image and project templates which act as a starting point for your application development.

Appsody stacks include language runtimes, frameworks and any additional libraries and tools that are required to simplify your local application development. Stacks are an easy way to manage consistency and adopt best practices across many applications.

Appsody Hub is the central point of control for Appsody Stacks where you can find available stacks, create new stacks, or modify existing ones. By making changes to the stacks in the hub, you can deploy updates to any application that's been built on them, simply by restarting the application.

*2. Appsody CLI:*

Working with the stacks, Appsody CLI provides commands that implement the full development lifecycle, so it has the ability to create a new or enable an existing application. Appsody CLI also provides commands to run, test, debug, and build an image and deploy it to Kubernetes. Appsody CLI works with Codewind so you can develop with the stacks directly in your choice of IDE using Codewind’s plugins. 

*3. Appsody Deploy:*

Appsody deploy allows you to create a standard production optimized container image of your cloud native Microservices then deploy that image into Kubernetes using the deploy command. Appsody deploy utilizes Appsody Operator which minimizes the configuration required to deploy the Microservice so now you can deploy using a serverless deployment either through Knative or a Kubernetes service. 

== 5. Codewind Overview: 

*Codewind:*

Codewind provides Kabanero with IDE integration and extensions to popular IDEs like VS Code, Eclipse, and Eclipse Che. As an open source project under Eclipse, Codewind gives you a set of tools for you to use to build high quality cloud native applications for Kubernetes regardless of the IDE or language you use. When Codewind enhances your IDE, you can run your applications in a Docker container. So you now can rapidly iterate, debug, and perform test apps inside containers with the same environment as production and in your preferred IDE. During the Codewind phase, developers can simply code and not concern themselves with any other tasks. 

Codewind consists of four key features: 

*1. Inner Loop:*

Codewind adopts the “inner loop” practice which basically is an iterative process that developers perform as they write, build, or debug code. The inner loop mostly has three parts: experimentation (example, coding), feedback collection (example, building) and tax (example, committing). Adopting the inner loop, Codewind quickens development and feedback.   

*2. Container Development Everywhere:*

Codewind can support application development on any Kubernetes cluster. If you use a local IDE plugin, Codewind provides support on the Docker. With Codewind, you use the same tools in local or hosted IDE and run in local containers or deploy directly on Kubernetes.    

*3. IDE Support:*

Codewind delivers native IDE integration with VS Code, Eclipse, and Eclipse Che. This way, regardless of your preferred IDE or language, you can use Codewind to build your cloud native application. 

*4. Developer Performanace Monitoring:*

Codewind automatically analyzes applications for performance issues. Configurable load testing makes code changes which immediately show through live and historical performance graphs. 

== 6. Tekton Overview:

*Tekton:*

Tekton is a Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. Tekton lets you build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems. Tekton provides open-source components to help standardize your CI/CD tooling and processes across vendors, languages, and deployment environments. 

Tekton pipeline is a collection of tasks, and each task is a set of instructions to execute within a container. The pipeline can then automate common activities in Kubernetes environments. Tekton takes all the work, development, build, and code from the Codewind phase and uses its pipeline to deploy Codewind’s outcomes to OpenShift Cloud. 

Tekton consists of four key features: 

*1. Steps:*

A step is a container spec which is a container image with all the information that you need to run it. Steps are also the most basic building blocks of Tekton pipelines.  Steps run in sequential order on the same Kubernetes node. 

*2. Tasks:*

Tasks are made up by steps. Tasks are custom resource definitions (CRDs). Tasks can run sequentially or concurrently on different nodes. Tasks make up a pipeline. 

*3. Pipelines:*

Pipelines express the order of the tasks. Pipelines connect the outputs of one task with the inputs of another. Pipelines: git clones, build docker images, publish images to repositories, and deploys images. 

*4. Dashboard:* 

The dashboard is the web user interface for Tekton Pipelines. The dashboard inputs runtime parameters into pipeline runs and views the execution logs of the pipeline runs. A deployment pipeline is an automated manifestation of your software process from version control all the way to production. It ensures a consistent, repeatable and reliable way to release software to production including new releases, fixes, security patches basically anything released to production should always go through this automated process.

IV. Create project +
V. Edit file +
VI. Test new endpoint +
VII. Debug app +
VIII. Run app +
IX. Nice work and where to next 

*I. WHy VS Code?* 

You can use Codewind for Visual Studio Code to develop and debug your containerizedprojects from within VS Code.

Write code, track application and build statuses, view project logs, and run your application.
Codewind for VS Code supports development of Microprofile/Java EE, Java Lagom, Spring, Node.js, Go, Python, Swift, and Appsody containerized projects.
In addition, the tools support easily debugging Microprofile/Java EE, Spring, and Node.js applications.

The VS Code tools are open source. You can browse the code, open issues, and contribute.

*II. Install Codewind for VS Code*

The Codewind installation includes two parts:

1. The VS Code extension installs when you install Codewind from the VS Code Marketplace or when you install by searching in the *VS Code Extensions* view. +
2. The Codewind back end containers install after you click *Install* when you are prompted. After you click *Install*, the necessary images are downloaded from the internet. The download is approximately 1 GB. +
3. Optional: If you don’t click *Install* when the notification window first appears, you can access the notification again. Go to the Explorer view, hover the cursor over *Codewind*, and click the switch so that it changes to the *On* position. The window appears. 

The following images are pulled. These images together form the Codewind back end:

1. eclipse/codewind-initialize-amd64 +
2. eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64 +
3. eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64 +
When the installation is complete, the extension is ready to use, and you area prompted to open the Codewind workspace.

Codewind creates the `~/codewind-workspace` folder to contain your projects. 
On Windows, you can find the workspace at the `C:\codewind-workspace` folder. 
You can open the `codewind-workspace` or a project within the workspace as your VS Code workspace. 

*III. Use Appsody template*

Instructions here on how to retrieve and use Appsody’s templates. 

*IV. Create project*

Note: Users will work with the a Java application that comes with the VS Code installation. 

1. Make the new project your workspace folder. This project is the only project that you need to work on for this tutorial.
    * Right-click the project and select `Open Folder as Workspace.` VS Code restarts with the selected project folder as the workspace folder.
2. Open the *Project Overview* page to view project information.
    * Right-click the project and select `Show Project Overview.`

*V. Edit file*

1. Open a file to edit. For example, modify the health endpoint of the default Node.js project. +
    * Open a Javascript file, such as `nodeproject/server/routers/health.js.` +
    * Make a code change. +
    * For example, you can add the following endpoint to `health.js` after the existing `GET `/ middleware function: +
    * router.get('/test', function (req, res, next) { +
    * return res.send("Yep, it worked!!"); +
    * }); +
    * Codewind detects the file changes and restarts your application. +
        ** In the Codewind tree, the application stops and starts again as the application server restarts. +
        ** You can also see *nodemon* restart the project in the application logs. 
	
At this point, your VS Code should look similar to the following example: 

*VI. Test default endpoint*

1. To make sure your code change was picked up, test your new endpoint. +
    * Right-click the project and select Open in Browser. The project root endpoint opens in the browser, and the *IBM Cloud Starter* page appears. +
    * Navigate to the new endpoint. If you copied the previous snippet, add `/health/test/` to the URL. +
    * See the new response: (screenshot image here)

*VII. Debug app*

 1. You can debug your application within the container. To debug a containerized project, restart it in *Debug* mode. +
    * Right-click the project and select Restart in Debug Mode. +
    * The project restarts into the *Debugging* state. +
    * A debug launch configuration is created in `nodeproject/.vscode/launch.json.` +
    * The debugger attaches, and VS Code opens the *Debug* view. +
    * You can detach and reattach the debugger at any time, as long as the project is still in *Debug* mode.
    
 2. All of the VS Code debug functionality is now available. +
    * If your code matches the screenshot, set a breakpoint at line 13 in `health.js.` +
    * Refresh the new endpoint page that you opened in step 7 so that a new request is made, and the breakpoint gets hit.
    
VS Code suspends your application at the breakpoint. Here you can step through the code, inspect variables, see the call stack, and evaluate expressions in the *Debug Console.*

*VIII. Run app*

Instructions here on how to run the application the user just built.

*IX. Nice work and were to next*

If you would also like to use Codewind with Eclipse Che or Eclipse, you may read instructions to install and work with those IDEs in this guide.

*I. Why Eclipse?*

You can use Codewind for Eclipse to develop and debug your containerized projects from within Eclipse.

Use the Eclipse IDE to create and make modifications to your application, see the application and build status, view the logs, and run your application.
Codewind for Eclipse supports development of Microprofile/Java EE, Java Lagom, Spring, Node.js, Go, Python, Swift, and Appsody containerized projects. 
In addition, Microprofile/Java EE, Spring, and Node.js applications can be debugged.

The Eclipse tools are open source. You are encouraged to browse the code, open issues, and contribute.

*II. Install Codewind for Eclipse*

The Codewind installation includes two parts:

1. The Eclipse plug-in installs when you install Codewind from the Eclipse Marketplace or when you install by searching in the *Eclipse Extensions* view. +
2. The Codewind back end containers install after you click *Install* when you are prompted. After you click *Install*, the necessary images are downloaded from the internet. The download is approximately 1 GB. +
3. Optional: If you don’t click *Install* when the notification window first appears, you can access the notification again. Go to the Explorer view, hover the cursor over *Codewind*, and click the switch so that it changes to the *On* position. The window appears.

The following images are pulled. These images together form the Codewind back end:

1. eclipse/codewind-initialize-amd64 +
2. eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64 +
3. eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64

When the installation is complete, the extension is ready to use, and you are prompted to open the Codewind workspace. 

Codewind creates the `~/codewind-workspace` folder to contain your projects.
On Windows, you can find the workspace at the `C:\codewind-workspace` folder. 
You can open the `codewind-workspace` or a project within the workspace as your Eclipse workspace. 

*III. Use Appsody template*

Instructions here on how to retrieve and use Appsody’s templates. 

*IV. Create project*

Note: users will work with the Java application that comes with the Eclipse installation.

You can work with your Codewind projects from the *Codewind Explorer* view in Eclipse.
If the view is not showing, open it as follows:

1. From the *Window* menu select *Show View > Other.* +
2. Start to type *Codewind* in the filter field or locate and expand the *Codewind* entry in the list. +
3. Select *Codewind Explorer* and click *Open.*

To create a new project or import an existing one, use the context menu on the *Local Projects* item in the *Codewind Explorer* view. 
Once you have a project, the first thing you might want to do is import your project into the Eclipse workspace so you can start editing files.
This also makes your source available for debugging.

Each project shows the application status and the build status. 
A context menu on each project enables you to open your application in a browser, view application and build logs, restart in debug mode, and much more.

When auto build is enabled for a project, Codewind for Eclipse detects when you make a change and starts a build automatically.
If you have disabled auto build for the project, you can start a build manually when you have made a change or a set of changes:

1. Right-click your project in the *Codewind Explorer* view and select *Build.* +
2. Wait for the project state to return to *Running* or *Debugging* in the *Codewind Explorer* view and then test your changes.

*V. Edit project files*

Editing actions are available by right clicking on the project in the *Codewind Explorer* view.
Most actions are only available if the project is enabled.

Some actions open the default Eclipse browser. 
If you find that the default Eclipse browser cannot handle the content, change the default browser by navigating to *Window > Web Browser* and selecting a different browser from the list.

Project settings tell Codewind more about the specifics of your project and can affect the status and/or behavior of your application. 
You can configure project settings when you:

1. Go to Project Overview page that is accessible from a project’s context menu, or, + 
2. Find the project settings in the *.cw-settings* file of the project which you can edit

*VI. Test new endpoint*

Instructions here on how to test the new endpoint

*VII. Debug app*

Codewind for Eclipse supports debugging Microprofile/Java EE and Spring projects.
The tools also help you set up a debug session for Node.js projects in a Chromium based browser.

*VIII. Run Application* 

Instructions here on how to run the application. 

*IX. Nice Work and Where to Next*

If you would like to use Codewind with Eclipse Che or VS Code, you may read instructions to install and work with those IDEs in this guide. 

To continue to learn about Codewind, visit Codewind API, https://eclipse.github.io/codewind/. 

== 9. Developing a simple app with Eclipse Che:

*Table of Contents*

I. Why Eclipse Che? +
II. Install Eclipse Che +
III. Set up OKD/OS +
IV. Add Registries in Che +
V. Set up Workspace +
VI. Create Project +
VII. Set up Tekton Pipeline +
VIII. Use Appsody Template 

*I. Why Eclipse Che?*

Codewind provides support for multiple users via Eclipse Che on Kubernetes. If Eclipse Che were installed via its Operator or with `--multiuser=true` on OpenShift, a Keycloak OIDC server will be installed alongside Che. When you log in to Che, you will be provided with your own dashboards, where you can create workspaces separate from other users. Che configurations and workspace settings are also per-user. Since Che workspaces are per-user, Codewind workspaces in Che are also per-user.

*II. Install Eclipe Che*

Prerequisites:

1. Kubernetes cluster with ingress installed +
2. Active kubectl context to the cluster

Install:

1. Determine your ingress domain. It should be of the form .nip.io. +
	* If you're running on IBM Cloud Private, this will be the public IP address of your proxy node. +
	* On other Kubernetes, use your master node IP address +
2. Configure kubectl for your cluster +
	* This will depend on your cluster +
	* On OpenShift use oc login, on IBM Cloud Private, use cloudctl login. +
3. Run ./install.sh to deploy Eclipse Che +
	* ./install.sh -h will show the available CLI options +
	* By default, it runs a helm install of Eclipse Che, but you can configure the install method used with the -mflag.
	
*III.  Set up OKD/OS*

Installing Che with deployment scripts:Git clone the `Eclipse Che repository`

1. Enter the `cd `command to go to the `deploy/openshift` directory +
2. Deploy Che with, ./deploy_che.sh +
3. To create a cluster role with the required permission, start from the Codewind Che plug-in repository and run the command, kubectl apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-clusterrole.yaml +
4. From the Codewind Che plug-in repository run the command, kubectl apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-rolebinding.yaml 

Enable privileged and root containers to run:Codewind is currently required to run as privileged (as it builds container images) and as root. Run the following commands to enable that functionality:

1. To enable privileged containers, enter, oc adm policy add-scc-to-group privileged system:serviceaccounts:eclipse-che 
2. To enable containers to run as root, enter, oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:eclipse-che 

*IV. Add Registries in Che*

Adding registries in Che:

After Che is started and running, add the container registry that will be used with Codewind.

1. On IBM Cloud Private, push your to any Docker registry except the internal Docker registry. +
2. On OpenShift or other Kube platforms, you can push your images to any Docker registry, such as Dockerhub, Quay.io, Google Cloud Registry (GCR), and more.

Complete the following instructions to add the registries:

1. Server: <registry-to-push-images-to> +
2. Username: <Your username> +
3. Password: <Your password>

Setting the Docker registry:

Upon creating a Codewind workspace. The container registry to deploy your projects to must be set. When you go to create or add an existing project to Codewind, Codewind will prompt you for the registry. See (Docker registry docs) for guidance on using proper container registries. 

If you would like to change the registry that’s used at any time, run the Codewind: Set Deployment Registry command in Theia to dynamically set a new registry for your workspace. 

Note: To proceed, you need to have added the registry credentials with Che.
	* Codewind restarts with the changes added.

Optional: Hosting a Devfile for creating the Che workspace with Codewind:
Skip this step if you are using the devfiles that Codewind provides by default. If you wish to host your own devfile, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the [Codewind Che plug-in repositoryhttps://github.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin). +
2. Make your modifications as you see fit. +
3. The devfile.yaml and meta.yaml files need to be hosted in a location that Che can access, such as Github. +
4. In devfile.yaml, modify the codewind-sidecar and codewind-theia components so that their ID formats match. To host the meta.yaml files, see: +
	* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/master/plugins/codewind/codewind-	sidecar/0.3.0/meta.yaml +
	* and, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/master/plugins/codewind/codewind-theia/0.3.0/meta.yaml 

*V. Set up workspace*

Confirm the Docker registry secrets:

Confirm that you added the docker registry secrets in the Che dashboard. Go to *Administration>Add Registry* to check for the secrets.

Creating the Codewind workspace with a Devfile:

The general format for creating a Che workspace via a factory is:

1. http://<che ingress domain>/f?url=<hosted devfile URL> 

We provide a ready-to-use devfile with the Codewind plug-ins. Enter the following URL to create a workspace from the devfile:

2. http://<che ingress domain>/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/master/devfiles/0.3.0/devfile.yaml 

For other sample devfiles, see:

3. https://github.com/kabanero-io/codewind-templates/tree/master/devfiles

Checking for the Codewind pod:

1. If you are using the Terminal, switch to use the workspace namespace. You can check for the namespace with kubectl get ns. +
2. Ensure the projects are cloned into the workspace. You might need to refresh the browser to trigger the clone.

*VI. Create project*

Note: users will work with the Java application that comes with the Eclipse installation 

Binding a project:

Go to *View>Find Command…>Codewind: Add Project.* 
	* Altenrative instructions: +
	* From the sidecar container, run the following command: curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://codewind-release:9191/api/v1/projects/bind -d '{"name": "microproj", "path": "/microclimate-workspace/microproj", "language": "java", "projectType": "liberty"}' 
	
Checking the status of a project:

Go to *View>Find Command…>Codewind: App status.* 
	*Alternative instructions: +
	* From the sidecar container, run the following command: curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET https://codewind-release:9191/api/v1/projects

Building a project:

Go to *View>Find Command…>Codewind: Build.* 
	* Alternative instructions: +
	* Enter the following command: curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://codewind-release:9191/api/v1/projects/8801a6d0-7805-11e9-b22f-19482c5ffbd6/build -d '{"action": "build"}'

*VII. Set up Tekton Pipeline*

Configuring Codewind for Tekton pipelines:

From your command line, enter the following commands if you want to use existing Tekton installations with Codewind:

1. oc apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-tektonrole.yaml +
2. oc apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-tektonbinding.yaml

*VIII. Use Appsody Template*
