= Getting Started with Codewind and Kabanero
:toc:

== Objectives

*Learning objectives*

In this guide you will learn how to develop a simple microservice with your chosen IDE, using Eclipse Codewind, an open source project, which provides IDE extensions for popular IDEs (VS Code and Eclipse IDE).  Eclipse Codewind provides the ability to create new projects based on Kabanero Collections that include application stacks customized to meet your company policies and consistently deploy applications and microservices at scale.

== Overview 

Kabanero's developer experience for IDEs is provided by Eclipse Codewind.  For more information on how Kabanero and its components work, visit https://kabanero.io/guides/overview/#architecture[Kabanero's Architecture and Development Workflows].

Kabanero installs on OKD (The Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes) or OpenShift and integrates a modern DevOps toolchain and Kabanero Collections which enable developers to use runtimes and frameworks in pre-built container images called `Application stacks`.  

Eclipse Codewind provides the ability to create application projects for these `Application Stacks` that your company has built, enabling developers to focus on their code and not infrastructure and Kubernetes.  Application deployments to Kubernetes occur via pipelines when developers commit their local code to the correct Git repos Kabanero is managing via webhooks.    

Eclipse Codewind provides the ability to create projects based on a variety of different template types.  These include IBM Cloud starters, Odo, and Appsody templates.  When used with Kabanero, you will only use Appsody templates for the Collections your company has enabled.  Today there are collections for: Eclipse MicroProfile/Java EE, Springboot, Node.js, Node.js with Express, Node.js with Loopback.

== Developing a simple microservice

Select the guide section based on your IDE of choice.

<<#developing-with-eclipse, developing with Eclipse>>

=== *Developing with VS Code*

If you use Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can use Codewind for VS Code to develop and debug your containerized projects from within VS Code using the workflow you already use today.

*Prerequisite*

Before you can develop a microservice with VS Code, you need to:

* https://docs.docker.com/install/[Install Docker] 
** [Note]: Make sure to install or upgrade to minimum Docker version 19.03. 
* https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Install VS Code]
 
*Installing Codewind for VS Code*

The Codewind installation includes two parts:

. The VS Code extension installs when you install Codewind from the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.codewind[VS Code Marketplace] and click `Install`. 
* Or, go to `View->Extensions`, search for Codewind, and click `Install`. 
. The Codewind backend containers install after you click `Install` when you are prompted. After you click `Install`, the necessary images are downloaded from the internet. The download is approximately 1 GB.
* [Optional]: If you donâ€™t click `Install` when the notification window first appears, you can access the notification again. Go to `View->Explorer`. Then click `Codewind` and hover the cursor over `Codewind` where there is a switch to turn Codewind on or off. Click the switch so that it is `On`. The notification window is displayed. 

The following images are pulled. These images together form the Codewind backend:
```
. eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64 
. eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64
```

*Creating an Appsody project*

Appsody helps you develop containerized applications and removes the burden of managing the full software development stack. If you want more context about Appsody, visit the https://appsody.dev/docs[Appsody welcome page]. 

. Under the Explorer pane, select `Codewind`.
. Expand `Codewind` by clicking the drop-down arrow. 
. Hover over the `Projects` entry underneath Codewind in the Explorer pane, and press the `+` icon to create a project.
* [Note]: Make sure Docker is running. Otherwise, you get an error. 
. Choose the `Appsody Eclipse MicroProfile template`. 
. Name your project `appsody-calculator`.
* If you don't see Appsody templates, find and select `Template Source Manager` and enable `Appsody Stacks - appsodyhub`. 
* The templates are refreshed, and the Appsody templates are available. 
. Press `Enter`. 
* To monitor your project's progress, right-click your project, and select `Show all logs`. Then an `Output` tab is displayed where you see your project's build logs. 

Your project is complete when you see your application status is running and your build status is successful. 

*Accessing the application endpoint in a browser*

. Return to your project under the Explorer pane. 
. Select the Open App icon next to your project's name, or right-click your project and select `Open App`. 

Your application is now opened in the browser, showing the welcome to your Appsody microservice page.

*Adding a REST service to your application*

 . Go to your project's workspace under the Explorer tab. 
 . Navigate to `src->main->java->dev->appsody->starter`.
 . Right-click `starter` and select `New File`.
 . Create a file, name it `Calculator.java`, and press `Enter`. This file is your JAX-RS resource. 
 . Populate the file with the following code.
 . Save the file after you input the code. 

```
package dev.appsody.starter;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;

@Path("/calculator")
public class Calculator extends Application {

    @GET
    @Path("/aboutme")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String aboutme(){
        return "You can add (+), subtract (-), and multiply (*) with this simple calculator.";
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{op}/{a}/{b}")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public Response calculate(@PathParam("op") String op, @PathParam("a") String a, @PathParam("b") String b)
    {
        int numA = Integer.parseInt(a);
        int numB = Integer.parseInt(b);

      switch(op)
      {
          case "+":
              return Response.ok(a + "+" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA + numB)))).build();

          case "-":
              return Response.ok(a + "-" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA - numB)))).build();

          case "*":
              return Response.ok(a + "*" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA * numB)))).build();

          default:
              return Response.ok("Invalid operation. Please Try again").build();
      }
    }
}
```
Any changes you make to your code will automatically be built and re-deployed by Codewind and viewed in your browser. 

*Working with the microservice* 

You now can work with your calculator.

. Use the port number you saw when you first opened the application.
. Make sure to remove the `< >` symbol in the URL. 
. `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/aboutme` 
. You should see the following response:

```
You can add (+), subtract (-), and multiply (*) with this simple calculator.
```

You could also try a few of the sample calculator functions: 

* `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/{op}/{a}/{b}`, where you can input one of the available operations `(+, _, *)`, and an integer a, and an integer b.
* So for `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/+/10/3` you should see: `10+3=13`.

*Nice work! Where to next?*

You have created a simple microservice using the VS Code IDE. For further learning:
